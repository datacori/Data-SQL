## Learning Goals
- Data Modeling  
- Data Architecture

---

## Data Modeling

### Definition

Data modeling is the process of **creating a visual or structured representation** that defines how organizational information is collected, managed, and stored.

It involves:
- Identifying what data exists in the business
- Analyzing what information is required for operations
- Representing the structure of an information system in an appropriate modeling form

In short, data modeling describes **how an information system is structured and how data elements relate to each other**.

---

### Importance of Data Modeling

- Ensures consistency between data documentation and system design across the organization
- Acts as a communication bridge between:
  - Business teams
  - Technical teams
- Enables accurate data analysis through:
  - Efficient data collection
  - Proper storage
  - Effective data processing
- Improves database performance and operational efficiency
- Helps identify potential risks in advance and suggests solutions

---

### Participants in Data Modeling

- All stakeholders involved in the project
- Developers
- Project managers
- Business domain experts

---

### Key Components of Data Modeling

- **Domain**  
  Defines the scope and subject area of the data

- **Relationship**  
  Describes how entities are connected to each other

- **Attributes**  
  Represents the properties or characteristics of an entity

---

## Data Architecture

Data architecture focuses on the **overall structure and strategy** for managing data within an organization.

It defines:
- How data flows through systems
- How data is stored, integrated, and accessed
- How data supports business processes and analytics

Data architecture provides a **high-level blueprint** that aligns data management with business goals.

# Modeling Perspectives & Data Architect Role

## Modeling Perspectives

### 1. Data Perspective (What)

Focuses on **what data exists** in the business.

- What data is related to the business processes?
- What relationships exist between data entities?

This perspective identifies the **structure and meaning of data** required by the organization.

---

### 2. Process Perspective (How)

Focuses on **how work is performed** and how data is handled.

- How is data processed through business workflows?
- What actions or tasks need to be performed?

This perspective describes **business processes and data handling logic**.

---

### 3. Interaction Perspective (Data–Process Interaction)

Focuses on the **interaction between data and processes**.

- How does data change depending on how tasks are performed?
- How do business processes impact data creation, modification, and usage?

This perspective explains **how data and processes influence each other** within real operations.

---

## Role of a Data Architect (DA)

A Data Architect is responsible for aligning **business requirements** with **technical data solutions**.

Key responsibilities include:

- Translating business requirements into technical data requirements
- Managing and enforcing data standards
- Designing and visualizing data management frameworks
- Establishing and maintaining data architecture
- Providing standard terminology for business operations
- Sharing strategic and long-term data requirements across teams
