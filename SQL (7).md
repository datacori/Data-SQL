## Data Modeling

### Definition

Data modeling is the process of **creating a visual or structured representation** that defines how organizational information is collected, managed, and stored.

It involves:
- Identifying what data exists in the business
- Analyzing what information is required for operations
- Representing the structure of an information system in an appropriate modeling form

In short, data modeling describes **how an information system is structured and how data elements relate to each other**.

---

### Importance of Data Modeling

- Ensures consistency between data documentation and system design across the organization
- Acts as a communication bridge between:
  - Business teams
  - Technical teams
- Enables accurate data analysis through:
  - Efficient data collection
  - Proper storage
  - Effective data processing
- Improves database performance and operational efficiency
- Helps identify potential risks in advance and suggests solutions

---

### Participants in Data Modeling

- All stakeholders involved in the project
- Developers
- Project managers
- Business domain experts

---

### Key Components of Data Modeling

- **Domain**  
  Defines the scope and subject area of the data

- **Relationship**  
  Describes how entities are connected to each other

- **Attributes**  
  Represents the properties or characteristics of an entity

---

## Data Architecture

Data architecture focuses on the **overall structure and strategy** for managing data within an organization.

It defines:
- How data flows through systems
- How data is stored, integrated, and accessed
- How data supports business processes and analytics

Data architecture provides a **high-level blueprint** that aligns data management with business goals.

---

## Key Learnings

- Data modeling translates business requirements into structured data designs
- Clear data models improve communication between technical and non-technical teams
- Understanding domains, relationships, and attributes is fundamental to database design
- Data architecture provides the big-picture view of how data supports the organization
