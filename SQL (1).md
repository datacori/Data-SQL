# SQL Fundamentals Study (2025-12-17)

## Learning Goals

Understand the basic concepts of databases

Learn the relationship between data and information

Compare File Systems vs Database Management Systems (DBMS)

Understand the features, advantages, and disadvantages of DBMS

---

## What is Data?

Data refers to raaw facts collected by observing or measuring the real world.

Objectively collected facts obrained through observation or measurement

Has basic, unit-level characteristics that serve as evidence for

```text
Analysis

Prediction

Forecasting

Decision-making
```
---

## Type of Data

### Quantitative data

Data that can be expressed numerically

Examples : numbers, figures, symbols, measurements

### Qualitative Data

Non-numerical data that describes characteristics or qualities

Examples : language, sound, text

Often used for explanation or summarization rather than calculation

---

## What is information?

Information is data that has been processed and organized in a meaningful way.

Created by processing data to add context and meaning

Results in outcomes that are useful for decision-making

Transforms raw data into actionable insights

---

## Relationship between data and information (DIKW Model)

The relationship between data and information can be explained using the DIKW hierarchy.

```text
Wisdom      → Ideas and decisions derived from knowledge
Knowledge   → Understanding patterns and making predictions
Information → Meaningful data created through processing
Data        → Raw facts and observed values
```
---

## Database

A database is a structured collection of logically related data that is stored and managed in an organized way.

Its goal is to minimize data redundancy and suppport efficient data management aligned with organizational objectives.

**Key characteristics of a database**
```text
Integrated data
Stored data
Operational data
Shared data
```

**Database features**
``` text
Real-time accessibility
Continuous evolution
Concurrent sharing
Content-based access
```
---

## File system

A file system is software that manages data by storing it in files.

It provides basic functions such as creating, deleting, modifying, and searching files.

In a file-based system, each applicaton manages its own data files independently

**Limitations of file system**
```text
High data dependency
Data redundancy
Inefficient data retrieval
```
---

## Data management system (DBMS)

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software designed to overcome the limitations of file systems.

It provides a structured and efficient way to store, manage, and access data.

**Core functions of a DBMS**
```text
Data definition
Data manipulation
Data control
```

## DBMS : Pros and cons

**Advantages**
```text
*Reduced Data Redundancy

Minimizes duplicate data, resulting in efficient use of storage space.

*Data Sharing

Enables multiple users and applications to access and share data simultaneously.

*Consistency, Integrity, and Security

Maintains accurate and reliable data while enforcing access control and security policies.

*Data Standardization

Provides standardized data formats and definitions across the organization.

*Logical and Physical Data Independence

Changes to data structure or storage do not directly affect application programs.
```

**Disadvantages**
```text
*Requires Specialized Personnel

Database design, management, and maintenance require skilled professionals.

*High System and Maintenance Costs

Includes hardware, software licenses, and operational expenses.

*Complex Backup and Recovery

Data backup and recovery processes can be difficult to manage.

*Performance Overhead with Large-Scale Access

Heavy concurrent disk access may lead to system overload.

## Key Learnings

Understanding the distinction between Data and Information

Fundamental concepts of Database Systems

## Reflections

With about two weeks left before the bootcamp begins, I decided to start learning SQL from scratch to build a stronger foundation.

I realized the importance of understanding data theory first before diving into practical SQL queries.

Compared to Python, SQL feels more challenging and unfamiliar, but I’m gradually adapting.

Keep going!
